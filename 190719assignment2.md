**Thoughts on this revised chart:**

When I first viewed this graphic I really liked the clear simplicity of it when it was all separated out. However as I continued parsing the information I found myself trying to compare the different data points, and wishing they were on the same graph. When I laid the Fourth Grade data out on one chart I really liked how the clarity remained, which I liked from the original. This was particularly evident once I customized the colors to emphasize the two categories related to students of color, which were the focus of the inquiry in the related article.
