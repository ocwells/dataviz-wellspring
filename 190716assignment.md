From the perspective of a data journalist the OIG findings were the most striking as they related to overcrowding at all stages of the immigration process. I drew on my experience as a New York Times reader to select the data that best showed the increase in human traffic at the border, and the resultant overuse of facilities. The New York Times is more restrained in its use of provocative photos than a tabloid or perhaps the New York Post, but I could see the inclusion of the report's photos to drive home the conditions at CBP facilities in a different newspaper. I also refrained from using animations, since they seemed to detract from the seriousness of the subject matter.

From the perspective of a DHS analyst the most significant findings in this report were related to the agency's non-compliance with it's own TEDS guidelines and the Flores Agreement. However, the departmental response to these findings provided some good news that I would include in the visualizations for this report to further characterize the situation at the southern border. The story here is more complex than just the increased human traffic and the inability of DHS to adequately address the increased migrant flow. His response speaks to the efforts agents have undertaken outside of enforcement to address the needs of immigrants at the border. I felt like that was an important part of the internal narrative, since I imagine the audience of this report to be primarily internal to DHS.
