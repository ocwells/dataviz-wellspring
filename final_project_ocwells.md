## Final Project Outline ##

# Description #

My final project will look at the pedestrian traffic flow on Forbes Avenue. Forbes Avenue was recently restriped, a city bus stop was removed, and two pedestrian crosswalks were installed. This has calmed the flow of vehicular traffic and provided a safer environment for pedestrians near the Carnegie Mellon campus. I recently heard that an additional improvement has been proposed, which is to remove a staircase in front of Hamburg Hall to dissuade pedestrians from crossing Forbes Avenue against traffic, a potential safety concern. I am curious as to how often pedestrians continue to cross against traffic with these traffic calming measures in place.

# Data #

My data was collected from 7/15 - 7/18/19 by my teenage son. He positioned himself on the second floor of the Tepper Business School building on Carnegie Mellon's campus. He observed Forbes Avenue pedestrian traffic from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm each day in a section where the traffic calming measures had been implemented. I will record the data from his data collection sheets in an Excel spreadsheet and conduct analysis on the flow of pedestrians. I will post this dataset within the repository for ease of access.
