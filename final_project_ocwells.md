## Final Project Outline ##

# Description #

My final project will look at the pedestrian traffic flow on Forbes Avenue. Forbes Avenue was recently restriped, a city bus stop was removed, and two pedestrian crosswalks were installed. This has calmed the flow of vehicular traffic and provided a safer environment for pedestrians near the Carnegie Mellon campus. I recently heard that an additional improvement has been proposed, which is to remove a staircase in front of Hamburg Hall to dissuade pedestrians from crossing Forbes Avenue against traffic, a potential safety concern. I am curious as to how often pedestrians continue to cross against traffic with these traffic calming measures in place.

# Data #

My data was collected from 7/15 - 7/18/19 by my teenage son. He positioned himself on the second floor of the Tepper Business School building on Carnegie Mellon's campus. He observed pedestrian traffic that crossed Forbes Avenue from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm each day in a section where the traffic calming measures had been implemented. I will record the data from his data collection sheets in an Excel spreadsheet and conduct analysis on the flow of pedestrians. I will post this dataset within the repository for ease of access.

# Method and Medium #

I will use Shorthand to build my final project since it will help me think of it as a data story rather than a collection of charts and paragraphs. I will work over the next two weeks to analyse the raw data, conduct a brief literature review of traffic flow studies for inspiration, and make some decisions about how to visualize this information. I understand that further pedestrian-focused improvements to Forbes Avenue are planned, and I want my data story to engage the Oakland pedestrian community in a dialogue about the traffic calming measures, as it is clear from early review of the data that Forbes Avenue is a pathway for a larger community, rather than a road that separates Heinz College from Tepper. I will present to the class on the second to last day of class.
