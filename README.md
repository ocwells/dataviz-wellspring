*Welcome to my dataviz page*

**About Me**
Hi everyone,
I'm Olivia, an MPM student in my second semester; my pronouns are her/she. I work at Carnegie Mellon for the Heinz College, so I should never have any trouble getting to class on time. :) I am looking forward to working with numbers in a more creative way, since I work with spreadsheets all day and very rarely get to do anything more creative with the data. After graduation, I hope to have learned skills that will inspire me in a new direction with my career, since my job can be monotonous and repetitive.

**What I Hope to Learn**
In this course, I expect to learn how to visualize data, which is something I have done only in fits and starts to date. Anyone can get Excel to spit out charts, but I look forward to learning more about how to produce really impactful visualizations.

**Portfolio**
My killer portfolio begins here...
