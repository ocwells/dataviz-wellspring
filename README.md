# Where Data gets a Makeover #

**About the Author**

I'm Olivia, an MPM student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College in my second semester; my pronouns are her/she. I work here too, so I never have any trouble getting to class on time. :smile: I am looking forward to working with numbers in a more creative way, since I work with spreadsheets all day and very rarely get to do anything more creative with the data. After graduation, I hope to use my new data visualization skills in my current role.

**What I Hope to Learn**
In this course, I expect to learn how to visualize data, which is something I have done only in fits and starts to date. I look forward to learning more about how to produce really impactful visualizations.
