# About Me
Hi everyone,
I'm Olivia, an MPM student in my second semester; my pronouns are her/she. I work at Carnegie Mellon for the Heinz College, so I should never have any trouble getting to class on time. :) I am looking forward to working with numbers in a more creative way, since I work with spreadsheets all day and very rarely get to do anything more creative with the data. After graduation, I hope to have learned skills that will inspire me in a new direction with my career, since my job can be monotonous and repetitive.

# What I Hope to Learn
In this course, I expect to learn how to visualize data, which is something I have done only in fits and starts to date. Anyone can get Excel to spit out charts, but I look forward to learning more about how to produce really impactful visualizations.

# Portfolio
My killer portfolio begins here...

From the perspective of a data journalist, the OIG findings were the most striking as they related to overcrowding at all stages of the immigration process. I drew on my experience as a New York Times reader to select the data that best showed the increase in human traffic at the border, and the resultant overuse of facilities. The New York Times is more restrained in its use of provocative photos than a tabloid or perhaps the New York Post, but I could see the inclusion of the report's photos to drive home the conditions at CBP facilities in a different newspaper. I also refrained from using animations, since they seemed to detract from the seriousness of the subject matter.
