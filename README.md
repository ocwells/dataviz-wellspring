# About Me
Hi everyone,
I'm Olivia, an MPM student in my second semester; my pronouns are her/she. I work at Carnegie Mellon for the Heinz College, so I never have any trouble getting to class on time. :) I am looking forward to working with numbers in a more creative way, since I work with spreadsheets all day and very rarely get to do anything more creative with the data. After graduation, I hope to use my new data visualization skills in my current role.

# What I Hope to Learn
In this course, I expect to learn how to visualize data, which is something I have done only in fits and starts to date. I look forward to learning more about how to produce really impactful visualizations.

## Labour Leans Left visualization ##
Due: 7/9/19

The original visualization for this data was a bit hard to understand due to the colors chosen and the truncated bar for the largest data point. Feel free to compare my redo with the source from the Economist [below](https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/08/13/the-metamorphosis)

**From the perspective of a data journalist** the OIG findings were the most striking as they related to overcrowding at all stages of the immigration process. I drew on my experience as a New York Times reader to select the data that best showed the increase in human traffic at the border, and the resultant overuse of facilities. The New York Times is more restrained in its use of provocative photos than a tabloid or perhaps the New York Post, but I could see the inclusion of the report's photos to drive home the conditions at CBP facilities in a different newspaper. I also refrained from using animations, since they seemed to detract from the seriousness of the subject matter.

*As a DHS Analyst*

**From the perspective of a DHS analyst** the most significant findings in this report were related to the agency's non-compliance with it's own TEDS guidelines and the Flores Agreement. However, the departmental response to these findings provided some good news that I would include in the visualizations for this report to further characterize the situation at the southern border. The story here is more complex than just the increased human traffic and the inability of DHS to adequately address the increased migrant flow. His response speaks to the efforts agents have undertaken outside of enforcement to address the needs of immigrants at the border. I felt like that was an important part of the internal narrative, since I imagine the audience of this report to be primarily internal to DHS.

**Thoughts on this revised chart:**

When I first viewed this graphic I really liked the clear simplicity of it when it was all separated out. However as I continued parsing the information I found myself trying to compare the different data points, and wishing they were on the same graph. When I laid the Fourth Grade data out on one chart I really liked how the clarity remained, which I liked from the original. This was particularly evident once I customized the colors to emphasize the two categories related to students of color.
