## Where Data gets a Makeover ##

# About the Author

I'm Olivia, an MPM student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College in my second semester; my pronouns are her/she. I work here too, so I never have any trouble getting to class on time. :) I am looking forward to working with numbers in a more creative way, since I work with spreadsheets all day and very rarely get to do anything more creative with the data. After graduation, I hope to use my new data visualization skills in my current role.

# What I Hope to Learn
In this course, I expect to learn how to visualize data, which is something I have done only in fits and starts to date. I look forward to learning more about how to produce really impactful visualizations.

**Thoughts on this revised chart:**

When I first viewed this graphic I really liked the clear simplicity of it when it was all separated out. However as I continued parsing the information I found myself trying to compare the different data points, and wishing they were on the same graph. When I laid the Fourth Grade data out on one chart I really liked how the clarity remained, which I liked from the original. This was particularly evident once I customized the colors to emphasize the two categories related to students of color.
